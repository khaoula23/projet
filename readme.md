## How to install

The vhost for this project is more complex than a simple PHP script, and is based on the Symfony Vhost style.
This configuration assumes that your site will be called **l2g.local** and use the directory **/var/www/l2g-platform/**. If you use something different you will have to adapt the vhost configuration.

Please be aware that in this project the root directory for PHP will be public/. All your public available resources should be available from this directory (eg.: public/css).

```apacheconfig
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName l2g.local

	DocumentRoot /var/www/l2g-platform/public
        DirectoryIndex /index.php

        <Directory /var/www/l2g-platform/public>
        	AllowOverride All
        	Order Allow,Deny
       		Allow from All

		FallbackResource /index.php
	 </Directory>

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error-l2g.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access-l2g.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

### Security

It is easy to prevent pages to be accessible only for logged in user or partners.

If you want to protect a page you need to start the route with a certain prefix:

- portal/ (only for logged in users)
- partner/ (only for partners)
